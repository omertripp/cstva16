\begin{abstract}
Conflict-driven clause-learning (CDCL) SAT solvers have deeply influenced
software engineering and security research over the last two decades, thanks
largely to the fact that these solvers can easily solve real-world constraints
with millions of variables and clauses in them. This phenomenon has puzzled
theoreticians and practitioners alike. It is widely believed that industrial
instances solved efficiently by SAT solvers are highly structured. However,
until recently there was little understanding of the structure of industrial
instances or the way solvers go about exploiting the said structure.
\\\\
In this talk, I will introduce CDCL SAT solvers, and the most important
heuristics that power them. In addition, I will give an answer to the question
of why SAT solvers are efficient on industrial instances. My answer is based on
empirical discoveries my collaborators, students, and I have made via a
rigorous and systematic experimental study of CDCL SAT solvers and industrial
instances. I will conclude with a mathematical model that incorporates our
empirical discoveries.
