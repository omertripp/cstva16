This archive was created by EasyChair, see
http://www.easychair.org. It contains the proceedings of LNCS
volume 9999 and is (hopefully) structured according
to the Springer LNCS requirements. The directories are named
VVVVVPPPP, where VVVVV is the volume number and PPPP is the first page
number of each paper. In each directory there is a file VVVVVPPPP.pdf
which contains a PDF file as submitted by the authors. Each directory
contains a file README_EASYCHAIR with the information on how to process
the files in this directory.

Note for the Springer Verlag Editors. If you have any problems with
the way EasyChair puts together LNCS proceedings, please contact
EasyChair using the contact page at http://easychair.org.
