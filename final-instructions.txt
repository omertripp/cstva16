Dear [*FIRST-NAME*],

You have already received the comments by the reviewers in a previous
email. Please take them carefully into account when preparing your
camera-ready paper for the proceedings. The final paper is due on

   May 24, 2016 (AOE)

This is a firm deadline for the production of the proceedings and you should
submit your paper using your EasyChair author account. 


1. FINAL PAPER: Please submit the files belonging to your camera-ready paper
using your EasyChair author account. Follow the instructions after the login
for uploading two files: 

   (a) either a zipped file containing all your LaTeX sources
       or a Word file in the RTF format, and
   (b) PDF version of your camera-ready paper.

For regular papers and extended abstracts, we increased the page limit by 2
pages for the final paper, so that the page limits are 12 pages for original
research papers and 8 pages for tool demonstration and fast abstract papers
(all using the easychair.cls class file and not including the references). For
presentation-only papers, please submit a document with only title and abstract
of your presentation (maximum 1 page). 


2. COPYRIGHT: We will publish the CSTVA 2016 proceedings as a CEUR volume
(http://ceur-ws.org/). If you would like your submission to be included in
these proceedings, please send a signed and completed copyright form (agreement
to publication) directly to cwinter@microsoft.com The copyright form can be

It is sufficient for one of the authors to sign the copyright form. You can
scan the form into PDF or any other standard image format.

again for your contribution to CSTVA 2016.

Sincerely,
