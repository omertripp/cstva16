POSSIBLE PROCEEDINGS: 
--------------------- 

We are planning to publish electronic proceedings as a CEUR Workshop Proceedings volume as announced in the call for papers. As communicated earlier, the ISSTA organization offered to publish all workshop proceedings formally with ACM, but due to copyright complications with some submissions we decided not to take them up on this offer.

REGISTRATION AND WORKSHOP ATTENDANCE:

Please note that the ISSTA conference and workshop registration is now open, with an early registration deadline of June 15, 2016. We hope that all of you will be able to attend the workshop in person.

Thank you and best regards, 
Omer & Christoph
